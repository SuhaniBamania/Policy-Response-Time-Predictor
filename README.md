This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts the **expected resolution time** for different cases, along with risk levels, priority, and anomaly detection.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts **resolution days** for RTI cases using a regression model.
- Classifies **risk level** and **priority**.
- Detects **season** based on filing month.
- Calculates **confidence score** for predictions.
- Performs **anomaly detection** if actual resolution days are provided.
- Web interface for input via HTML form.
- API endpoint (`/predict`) for JSON-based predictions.
